In the years after the Civil War, Parkman was arrested and imprisoned for cotton speculation.  While in prison, Parkman attempted to escape but was shot and killed in the process.  When his wife was forced to sell their house a few years after his death, his ghost began to appear regularly throughout the house and grounds, where it is still seen to this day.  People often report hearing windows and doors being opened and shut when no one else is in the house, as well as doors that close behind people and lock on their own.  The apparitions of two little girls are also frequently seen, though their identities remain unknown.");

Apart from these unnamed apparitions, the original owner, Thomas Whaley, his wife, one of their children, a little girl, and a convict are repeatedly seen within the house.  The house was apparently haunted as soon as it was built, as the spirit of a man who had been convicted and hanged on the site took up residence in the house upon its completion.  The Whaley apparitions are often seen engaged in the normal activities of their former day to day lives.  Doors have been known to close and lock on their own, and footsteps are often heard throughout the house, along with music and the crying of a baby.");

Today, the building is used by the American Institute of Architects as a museum, but it has also made quite a name for itself as a center for paranormal activity, as far back as the mid-19th century.  The central staircase is a major hotspot for the supernatural, as footsteps are often heard, along with the saddened voice of a woman.  Doors have been locked only to suddenly be found standing wide open.  Lights turn on and off on their own, and footsteps – and even faint footprints! – have been reported throughout the building, and objects often move without human interference.");

The Kehoe family, however, seems to have remained in residence long after their deaths, going about their usual routines while also interacting with guests and staff.  Mrs. Kehoe has often been seen sitting at a desk, writing, or sitting on the beds of sleeping guests.  Mr. Kehoe has been seen throughout the house as well, and on one occasion opened all of the exterior locked doors on the first floor…simultaneously.  The young twin boys of the Kehoe’s, who died in a childhood accident, have also been seen roaming throughout the house, and their noisy footsteps heard as they run across the upper floors.");
